Playtime
=============

Playtime is a minimal addon to keep track of and print total playtime across all characters. Nothing more. No dependencies, and unlikely to break with future versions of World of Warcraft.

Character playtime is stored on login/logout per character, and you can print total playtime using ```/playtime```.
